Proyecto: An√°lisis de mercado inmobiliario
Problem

I recently joined the Data team of a large real estate company. The first task assigned to me is to help the valuers/ers to value properties, 
as it is a difficult and sometimes subjective process. To do this, I propose to create a machine learning model that, 
given certain characteristics of the property, predicts its selling price.
